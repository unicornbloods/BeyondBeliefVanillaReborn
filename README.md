<b> Minecraft version does not matter with my shaders! It should work on all versions that have Optifine. </b> <br>
I just mainly test on the latest version.

Welcome to my new project! <br> 
This one is based around adding a little bit extra to vanilla Minecraft and doing so in a fully customizable way!! <br>
If you have any bug or suggestions please shoot them over to <a href="https://github.com/unicornbloods/BeyondBeliefVanillaReborn/issues"> here. </a>

Installation: <br>
